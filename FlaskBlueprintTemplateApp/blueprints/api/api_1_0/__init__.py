API 1.0 - Blueprint.

We initialize the Blueprint object of our API here so we can share it in all
submodule.

This will be register into the Flask Application via the register_blueprint().
You have to add your new blueprint in register_blueprint for Flask to load it.

api = Blueprint('api_1_0', __name__)

#: Import all submodule of this API

#: This is done at the end of the file to avoid cyclic import module as
